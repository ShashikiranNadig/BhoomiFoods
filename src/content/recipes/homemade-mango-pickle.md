This authentic Karnataka-style mango pickle recipe has been passed down through generations in my family. The tangy, spicy flavors will transport you straight to South India!

## Ingredients

- 2 kg raw mangoes (small, firm)
- 1/2 cup salt
- 1/2 cup red chili powder
- 1/4 cup turmeric powder
- 1/4 cup mustard seeds
- 2 tbsp fenugreek seeds
- 1/4 cup asafoetida
- 1 cup mustard oil
- 2 tbsp jaggery (optional)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Mangoes
1. Wash the raw mangoes thoroughly and pat them dry
2. Cut them into small pieces (about 1-inch cubes)
3. Remove the seeds but keep the skin on for texture

### Step 2: Salt the Mangoes
1. Place the mango pieces in a large bowl
2. Add salt and mix well
3. Let it sit for 2-3 hours to draw out excess moisture
4. Drain the water that accumulates

### Step 3: Prepare the Spice Mix
1. Dry roast mustard seeds and fenugreek seeds separately until fragrant
2. Grind them to a coarse powder
3. Mix with red chili powder, turmeric powder, and asafoetida

### Step 4: Combine Everything
1. Add the spice mix to the salted mangoes
2. Mix well to ensure all pieces are coated
3. Add jaggery if you prefer a slightly sweet pickle

### Step 5: Add Oil
1. Heat mustard oil until it starts smoking
2. Let it cool completely
3. Pour the cooled oil over the mango mixture
4. Mix well

### Step 6: Store
1. Transfer to clean, dry glass jars
2. Store in a cool, dry place
3. The pickle will be ready to eat in 3-4 days
4. It can be stored for up to a year

## Tips for Success

- Use only firm, raw mangoes for the best texture
- Ensure all utensils are completely dry to prevent spoilage
- The oil should completely cover the pickle
- Store in a cool, dark place for best results
